# 3D-Multiple-Colorful-Balls-Turtle
The Multi-Turtle Spirograph ball creating project is a Python application that creates intricate spirograph patterns using multiple turtles from the Turtle graphics module. This project showcases the power of procedural graphics and the use of multiple turtle objects to generate complex and colorful designs

 Each turtle contributes to the overall pattern by drawing its own unique spirograph, resulting in a mesmerizing and dynamic piece of art.

Features
1) Multiple Turtles: Utilizes five different turtles, each drawing its own spirograph pattern, adding complexity and variety to the final design.
2) Color Randomization: Each turtle uses a random color generator to ensure vibrant and unique patterns.
3) Fast Rendering: All turtles are set to the fastest speed to ensure quick and smooth drawing.
4) Dynamic Patterns: The spirograph patterns are drawn dynamically, with each turtle following its own unique path.

How it Works:
Following are the functions used:
Here are all the user-defined functions in the given program:

1. **`random_color()`**
   - Generates and returns a random RGB color tuple.

2. **`circle_tammy(size_gap)`**
   - Draws a spirograph pattern using the `tammy` turtle, starting from a specific position and with a given size gap.

3. **`circle_tommy(size_gap)`**
   - Draws a spirograph pattern using the `tommy` turtle, starting from a specific position and with a given size gap.

4. **`circle_tummy(size_gap)`**
   - Draws a spirograph pattern using the `tummy` turtle, starting from a specific position and with a given size gap.

5. **`circle_alfred(size_gap)`**
   - Draws a spirograph pattern using the `alfred` turtle, starting from a specific position and with a given size gap.

6. **`draw_spirograph(size_gap)`**
   - Draws a spirograph pattern using the `timmy` turtle, with a given size gap.
